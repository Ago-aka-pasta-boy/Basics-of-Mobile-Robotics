"""Applies a Kalman filter and returns current state x,y,theta as a 3*1 np.array
Inputs:
    - state = np.array([x_k-1,y_k-1,theta_k-1]) is the state at step k-1. theta is in rad.
    - Sigma is the 3*3 np.array which corresponds to the covariance matrix of the states
    - motorspeed = [speedR, speedL] is the motor.target which is given to Thymio at step k (units unknown)
    - history = [state_(k-N), state_(k-(N-1)), ..., state(k-1)] where N is the horizon chosen for keeping the history
    - camera = [(x,y), theta, is_working] is the position of thymio given by vision. 
    is_working is a boolean that indicates whether the camera faced an issue.
    - Ts is the sampling time in seconds

Outputs:
    updated versions of state, Sigma, history at step k
