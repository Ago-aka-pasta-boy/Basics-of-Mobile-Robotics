    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> The basics of mobile robotics' project consists in a visit of Paris. Thymio is on holiday in Paris. He had a long day, so he intends to stroll down the Champs Elysées and under the Arc of Triomphe by the shortest path through traffic. Then, Thymio wants to enjoy a view of the Eiffel Tower, still by the shortest path. During his walk, some Parisians in a hurry crosses his road but thanks to his good ability, Thymio avoids them and continues along the streets. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "<p> The ground where Thymio navigates is white.  parler de la dimension de notre set up ?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "<p> The project's set-up is composed of a goal positions represented by a green circle. Parler du diamètre ? </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robot \n",
    "<p> The robot is recognizable by two blue circles on top of it. The two circles have different sizes in order to know the direction of Thymio (small circle on the front and big circle on the back of the robot). parler du diamètre ?  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permanent obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arc of Thriomphe\n",
    "<p> The Arc of Triomphe is a 3D rectangle obstacle in red with brown sides. Thymio should pass under this obstacle. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other obstacles\n",
    "<p> The other obstacles are in 2D and are black top. They have different shapes : triangles and squares. </p>\n",

    "### Unforeseen obstacles \n",
    "<p> The unforeseen obstacles is a 3D white cylinder. </p>\n",

    "1. Listing all points on the graph. <br>\n",
    "In this step, the coordinates of every obstacle's vertices, as well as start's and goal's coordinates, are read and stored together in a list. <br>\n",
    "Also, all coordinates are transformed into instances of class check_intersection.Point. This will allow us to use the function check_intersection.doIntersect() more easily.<br>\n",
    "*The code check_intersection.py was taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-given-line-segments-intersect/ (cons. 27.11.2021) and was developed by Ansh Riyal.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Listing all obstacle sides.<br>\n",
    "In this step, we want to construct each obstacle as a series of vertex indices. For example, a triangle could be stored as [(1,2),(2,3), (3,1)]. <br>\n",
    "To do so, we start by counting how many vertices (i.e. how many sides) each obstacle has. <br>\n",
    "Then, for each obstacle, we build a list of its sides. To do so, we first need to calculate a shift k from which to start giving vertices' indices. For example, for an obstacle whose first vertex's name is k and which has v vertices, the result would be: [(k,k+1), (k+1,k+2), ..., (k+(v-1), k)]. <br>\n",
    "Finally, we store all lists of sides into a bigger list.\n",

    "#### Optimal path finding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the visibility graph is known, we can explore it to determine which path leads to the goal in an optimal way. This relies on the A* algorithm (the logic and pseudo-codes used in this section are inspired from the lecture slides and the Wikipedia page on A* algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm, *cons. 08.12.2021*). <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for finding the optimal path is given in shortest_path.py. Its most relevant function that is called in main code is find_shortest_path(). <br>\n",
    "It takes as input:\n",
    "- obstacle_vertices, which is the same vector used for building the visibility graph\n",
    "- start and goal position, as above <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns a list: names_full_path = [0, v1, v2, ..., vP, P+1] where each entry is the index of a point. Again, 0 correspond to start ; v1,v2,...,vP is the P-steps path to follow ; and P+1 is the goal.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We coded the module in a way that it can apply either A* (with Euclidean distance from goal as a heuristic) or Dijkstra (with a heuristic=0 for all points). To use Dijkstra, the function must be called without specifying the start and goal positions. <br>\n",
    "After testing, we decided to use A* for the final implementation as it seemed to yield better results than Dijkstra. <br/><br/>\n",

    "4. Attribute infinite weight to every point of the graph, except the start (weight_start = 0 + heuristic)\n",
    "5. Initialize the following lists: \n",
