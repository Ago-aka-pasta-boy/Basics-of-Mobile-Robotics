    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> The basics of mobile robotics' project consists in a visit of Paris. Thymio is on holiday in Paris. He had a long day, so he intends to stroll down the Champs Elysées and under the Arc of Triomphe by the shortest path through traffic. Then, Thymio wants to have a rest at the hotel  while enjoying a view of the Eiffel Tower, still by the shortest path. During his walk, some Parisians in a hurry crosses his road but thanks to his good ability, Thymio avoids them and continues along the streets. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "<p> The ground where Thymio navigates is white.  parler de la dimension de notre set up ?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "<p> The project's set-up is composed of a goal positions represented by a green circle. Parler du diamètre ? </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robot \n",
    "<p> The robot is recognizable by two blue circles on top of it. The two circles have different sizes in order to know the direction of Thymio (small circle on the front and big circle on the back of the robot). parler du diamètre ?  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permanent obstacles\n",
    "<p> All permanent obstacles are in 3D with different coloured papers on top of them. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arc of Thriomphe\n",
    "<p> The Arc of Triomphe is a rectangle and red obstacle with brown sides. Thymio should pass under this obstacle. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other obstacles\n",
    "<p> The other obstacles have a black top and their sides are white. They have different shapes : triangles and squares. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unforeseen obstacles \n",
    "<p> The unforeseen obstacles is a white cylinder. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera\n",
    "<p> The camera used for the project is the camera provided in class. It is ....parler du modèle ? . The camera is hung to a lamp on top of the set-up.</p>\n"

These obstacles can be put in Thymio's path at any point in time so that the Thymio should leave the optimal path to avoid them. Once the obstacle is passed, the robot has to go back to the initial optimal path. There are many possibilities to implement a local avoidance using the proximity sensors : with an ANN or not. </p>\n",
